This is lenovo K860i kernel source code .

linux version is 3.0.15.


I put it here because I need help with audio playback on K860i : The stock ROM force audio output at 48Khz while most audio files have a 44.1Khz frequency.

Can you please help with this?


Codesourcey 2009Q3 works well to complie the kernel.




make stuttgart_android_defconfig
make -j4.
